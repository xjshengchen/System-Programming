fcntl:
       fcntl() performs one of the operations described below on the open
       file descriptor fd.  The operation is determined by cmd.

       fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this
       argument is required is determined by cmd.  The required argument
       type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most cases,
       the required type is int, and we identify the argument using the name
       arg), or void is specified if the argument is not required.

Advisory locking

       F_GETLK, F_SETLK and F_SETLKW are used to acquire, release, and test
       for the existence of record locks (also known as file-segment or
       file-region locks).  The third argument, lock, is a pointer to a
       structure that has at least the following fields (in unspecified
       order).
